# Hi, I'm Kripan K C

## Geospatial Data Scientist | Environmental Risk Analyst

I develop scalable solutions for complex geospatial problems using innovative algorithms and production-grade software engineering. Currently pursuing my Master's in Environmental Engineering at Technical University of Munich (CGPA: 1.48), with a focus on applying GIS, remote sensing, and environmental modeling to climate risk assessment and hazard analysis.

### Current Work

**Geospatial Analysis Intern** @ Munich Re  
Developing production-grade algorithms for large-scale spatial processing, memory optimization, and climate risk modeling. Building APIs for operational risk assessment platforms.

**Research Assistant** @ TUM Chair of Hydrology and River Basin Management  
Conducting flood risk analysis using remote sensing, modeling, and advanced data techniques.
